The goal of science is to produce knowledge that has general utility. Basically, you look for sets of rules, preferably mathematical, that let you reliably predict the future (or the past). There is also a semi-official principle advising that simpler rules are better. The rules go by many names, but I will just call them *theories.* 

The world of theory is a shimmering paradise of airy principles and beauteous mathematics. Theories are glorious men-of-war, colourful pennants flying in the sunshine, sailing off to the horizon to do battle with *data.* Data is treacherous and fickle, and loves nothing more than to burn the unwary.

One of the highlights of my undergraduate computer science program (in the late 1990s) was a series of electronics, digital design and computing courses involving constructing robots from LEGO, equipping them with some hand-made sensors, and programming them to do interesting things. The pinnacle of these was the Western Canadian Robot Games Firefighting Contest: to design a robot to navigate a maze, detect a lit candle, and extinguish it, in the shortest possible time. 

Upon completing this course arc I registered for a pair of self-directed project courses. With my LEGO-robot knowledge, the discovery of an old oscilloscope nobody was using, and high school science fair experience with an obscure little algorithm called the artificial neural network, I thought I would try to build a robot that could learn to navigate, rather than being programmed to do so. 

In the great tradition of the computer scientist, I first built a simulation, and successfully trained little sim-bots to scurry away from simulated lights, like little virtual cockroaches. Now all that was left to do was to download those little insect brains into a robot and run around the room chasing them with flashlights! But this is where my perfect little digital creations met their greatest challenge: the messy, complicated, imperfect analog world.

### Mathematics and Computation

Mathematics is

In high school in the mid to late 1990s, I entered a series of science fairs with projects based on an obscure algorithm called the artificial neural network. My first attempts created a program that could learn to recognize the letters of the alphabet, individually hand drawn by clicking to highlight cells in a grid on screen. Armed with this success, I wanted to 





I am a doctor of philosophy. Specifically, a weird little sub-branch of philosophy that holds to some odd principles. Ideas, it says, are not all equal. They should be tested, and those that allow us to reliably predict the future (or the past) should be retained.

That branch of philosophy is called science.

Predicting the future has some implications. First, it means that the universe is consistent.
